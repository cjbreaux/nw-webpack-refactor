### Description

* This is a refactor of an earlier project. The goal of the original project was to utilize custom animations to create a simple game. 
The code is currently being re-worked to take advantage of webpack, CSS grid, repsonsive web design. The game itself allows players to "shoot"
projecticles at moving targets. The targets will react if they are struck by the projectile.
